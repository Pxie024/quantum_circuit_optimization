# quantum_circuit_optimization
This project aims to solve qubit placement problems in nearest neighbour compliance quantum circuits. We approached the problem using integer linear programming, and solve for the exact global optimal solution. 

The Python files contain the implemented ILP models that we used to solve the problem, and the solver code for each of the benchmark instances.

The .dat files contains details of the instances we included in the final report.

and the file "report_aug28" is the thesis for this entire project.
