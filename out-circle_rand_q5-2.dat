! Arcs (two-dimensional matrix, where the first element is the origin and the second is the destination)
ARCS: 
[
(1	1)	1	2
(2	1)	3	4
(3	1)	3	1

!Shortest Path Matrix (in terms of arcs). The generic element (i, j) counts the number of arcs between the origin and the destination, considering the network as non-oriented 
P:
[
0	1	1	2	2	
1	0	2	2	1	
1	2	0	1	2	
2	2	1	0	1	
2	1	2	1	0

!PATH O-D. Matrix containing the nodes composing a path. If a path has 3 nodes and another path has 5 nodes, the last two elements of the 3 node paths are equal to 0. The format is (a b c)....., where a is the origin, b is the destination and c identifies the first element of the NODEPATH matrix.

!ARCPATH. This is the matrix identifying the arcs belonging to a path. The generic element is the idenfitier of the arc, whle the zero element indicates the end of the path. Zeros are needed to complete the paths whose lenght is lower than the maximum one.
